#' Estimates U.S. HWP contribution to annual greenhouse gas removals.
#'
#' Uses formulas described in WOODCARB II paper to calculate contribution contribution
#' with the HWP variables.
#'
#' Decay type and half life options allow for analysis of contribution levels under
#' different circumstances.
#'
#' The Production Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon stock change in HWP and
#' forests where the carbon is from trees harvested in the reporting country.
#'
#' The Stock Change Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon stock change in HWP and
#' forests in a country regardless of wood origin.
#'
#' The Atmospheric Flow Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon fluxes between
#' the atmosphere and forests/HWPs within a country.
